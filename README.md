## Abstract
The proposed study focuses on the use of Artificial Intelligence for the analysis and recognition of physiological signals, enabling the identification of patterns and anomalies in biological data. This application has significant relevance in the medical field, aiding in diagnostics, health monitoring of specific individuals, and the understanding of human physiological processes.

The data used in this study are part of research conducted by the University of Pisa and the Polytechnic University of Milan, focusing on Brain-Heart interaction analysis. The dataset includes recordings from 26 healthy subjects, consisting of EEG, respiratory activity, and ECG signals.

The aim of the study was to develop a model capable of accurately identifying the presence (peak) or absence (non-peak) of cardiac beats in the collected data. The ultimate goal was to recognize Heart Rate Variability (HRV) from EEG signals.

The research addressed the problem as a binary classification task, aiming to maximize the model's accuracy in detecting cardiac peaks. This metric is influenced not only by the choice of the model but also by the specific parametrizations used within it. Various models and configurations were explored, each with distinct characteristics.

The study initially focused on identifying the best model for data processing, followed by testing its performance under different parameter settings. These parameters were chosen based on their impact and utility in improving the model's accuracy.

The results provided insights into the feasibility of applying a model to this dataset and highlighted which parameter configurations could enhance or reduce its performance. The best results were achieved using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) after exploring various hyperparameter settings.
